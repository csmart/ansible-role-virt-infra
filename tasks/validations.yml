# Using fail or assert module removes the host from inventory on a task failure
# We don't really want to do that, as we want to discover all problems at same time
# If KVM host fails a task and is removed from inventory, then we can't run subsequent tests for guests
# Thus we abort the play entirely straight away if KVM host is unreachable
# Otherwise, we don't abort but instead set a variable when anything fails
# We then print out any errors and end the play after the checks have completed
# This means we can perform all checks for all hosts so you know all things you need to fix
