# Ansible Role: Virtual Infrastructure

This role is designed to define and manage networks and guests on a KVM host.
Ansible's _--limit_ option lets you manage them individually or as a group.

It is really designed for dev work, where the KVM host is your local machine,
you have sudo and talk to libvirtd at qemu:///system (although in theory it
supports a remote KVM host).

Setting guest states to _running_, _shutdown_, _destroyed_ or _undefined_ (to
delete and clean up) are supported.

You can set whatever memory, CPU, disks and network cards you want for your
guests, either via hostgroups or individually. A mixture of multiple disks is
supported, including _scsi_, _sata_, _virtio_ and even _nvme_.

You can create private NAT libvirt networks on the KVM host and then put VMs on
any number of them. Guests can use those libvirt networks or _existing_ bridge
devices (e.g. br0) and Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge on the KVM host (this won't
create bridges on the host, but it will check that the bridge interface
exists). You can specify the MAC for each interface if you require.

You can also create routed libvirt networks on the KVM host and then put VMs on
any number of them. In this case, a new bridge is created with the name you
specify (e.g. br1), wired to an _existing_ interface (e.g. eth0). You can
specify the MAC for each interface if you require.

This supports various distros and uses their qcow2 [cloud
images](#guest-cloud-images) for convenience (although you could use your own
images). I've tested CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and openSUSE.

The qcow2 cloud base images to use for guests are specified as variables in the
inventory and should exist under libvirt images directory (default is
_/var/lib/libvirt/images/_). That is to say, this won't download the images for
you automatically.

Guest qcow2 boot images are created from those base images and cloud-init is
used to configure guests on boot up. The cloud-init ISOs are created
automatically and attached to the guest. Timezone will be set to match the KVM
host by default.

By default, your shell username will also be used for the guest, along with
your public SSH keys on the KVM host (you can override that). Host entries are
added to /etc/hosts on the KVM host so you can SSH straight in (but it doesn't
modify your SSH config yet). You can set a root password if you really want to.

With all that, you could define and manage OpenStack/Swift/Ceph clusters of
different sizes with multiple networks, disks and even distros!

## Requirements

All that's really needed is a Linux host, capable of running KVM, some guest
images and a basic inventory. Ansible will do the rest (on supported distros).

**NOTE:** The Ansible will install KVM, libvirtd and other required packages on
supported distros and also make sure the libvirtd is running.

A working x86_64 KVM host where the user running Ansible can communicate with
libvirtd via sudo.

It expects hardware support for KVM in the CPU so that we an create accelerated
guests and pass the CPU through (supports nested virtualisation).

You may need Ansible and Jinja >= 2.8 because this does things like 'equalto'
comparisons.

I have tested this on CentOS 8, Fedora 3x, Debian 10, Ubuntu Bionic/Eoan and
openSUSE 15 hosts, but other Linux machines probably work.

At least one SSH key pair on your KVM host (the Ansible will generate one if
missing).

Several user space tools are also required on the KVM host (the Ansible will
install these on supported hosts).

* qemu-img
* osinfo-query
* virsh
* virt-customize
* virt-sysprep

Download the guest images you want to use ([this is what I
downloaded](#guest-cloud-images)) and put them in libvirt images path (usually
_/var/lib/libvirt/images/_). This will check that the images you specified
exist and error if they are not found.

### KVM host

Here are some instructions for configuring your KVM host, in case they are
useful.

#### Fedora

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# libvirtd
sudo dnf install -y @virtualization
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible
sudo dnf install -y ansible

# Other deps (installed by playbook)
sudo dnf install -y \
git \
genisoimage \
libguestfs-tools-c \
libosinfo \
python3-libvirt \
python3-lxml \
qemu-img \
virt-install
```

#### CentOS 7

CentOS 7 won't work until we have `libselinux-python3` package, which is coming in 7.8...

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719978
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1756015

But here are (hopefully) the rest of the steps for when it is available.

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# libvirtd
sudo yum groupinstall -y "Virtualization Host"
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible and other deps
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y python36
pip3 install --user ansible

sudo yum install -y \
git \
genisoimage \
libguestfs-tools-c \
libosinfo \
python36-libvirt \
python36-lxml \
libselinux-python3 \
qemu-img \
virt-install
```

#### CentOS 8

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# libvirtd
sudo dnf groupinstall -y "Virtualization Host"
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible
sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y ansible

# Other deps (installed by playbook)
sudo dnf install -y \
git \
genisoimage \
libguestfs-tools-c \
libosinfo \
python3 \
python3-libvirt \
python3-lxml \

```

#### Debian

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# libvirtd
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible
sudo apt install -y gnupg2
echo 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu trusty main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367

```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# libvirtd
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system qemu-kvm
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common

libguestfs-tools \
libosinfo-bin \
python3-libvirt \
python3-lxml \
qemu-utils \

```

#### openSUSE

If you're running JeOS, we need to change the kernel to `kernel-default` as
`kernel-default-base` which comes with JeOS is missing KVM modules.

```bash
# Create SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen

# Install suitable kernel
sudo zypper install kernel-default
sudo reboot
```

Continue after reboot.

```bash
# libvirtd
sudo zypper install -yt pattern kvm_server kvm_tools
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

# Ansible
sudo zypper install -y ansible

# Other deps (installed by playbook)
sudo zypper install -y \
git \
guestfs-tools \
libosinfo \
mkisofs \
python3-libvirt-python \
python3-lxml \
qemu-tools \
virt-install
```

#### Using routed networks

You can route traffic into a newly created bridge by specifying forward *type: route*.
This code supports automatic creation of a new bridge named *bridge_dev* which will be
wired onto an existing interface in the host, specified by parameter *host_dev*.

The example below shows how a bridge can be created, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6:

```yaml
kvmhost:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      virt_infra_host_libvirt_url: qemu:///system
  vars:
    virt_infra_host_networks:
      present:
        - name: example
          domain: f901.example.com
          type: route
          host_dev: eth0
          bridge_dev: virbr1
          bridge_stp: on
          bridge_delay: 0
          mac: 52:54:00:f9:01:00
          ip_address: 10.249.1.1
          ip_netmask: 255.255.255.0
          dhcp_start: 10.249.1.11
          dhcp_end: 10.249.1.254
          ip6_address: 2001:0db8::f901:1
          ip6_prefix: 64
          dhcp6_start: 2001:0db8::f901:0000
          dhcp6_end: 2001:0db8::f901:00ff
```

Notes:

1. The IPv6 block 2001:0db8/32 as shown above is provided for the sake of documentation
   purposes only. You will have to substitute that by your own delegated /48 block
   (in general) given to you by your IPv6 provider or by a IPv6 over IPv4 tunnelling
   solution such as [Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker service](http://tunnelbroker.net/).

2. It's highly recommended that you stick with *ip6_prefix: 64*, since it is the
   recommended setting in Libvirt documentation.

#### Configuring bridges with NetworkManager

This code supports connecting VMs to both Linux and Open vSwitch bridges, but
they must already exist on the KVM host.

Here is how to convert an existing ethernet device into a bridge. Be careful if
doing this on a remote machine with only one connection! Make sure you have
some other way to log in (e.g. console), or maybe add additional interfaces
instead.

First, export the the device you want to convert so we can easily reference it
later (e.g.  `eth1`).

```bash
export NET_DEV="eth1"
```

Now list the current NetworkManager connections for your device exported above
so we know what to disable later.

```bash
sudo nmcli con |egrep -w "${NET_DEV}"
```

This might be something like `System eth1` or `Wired connection 1`, let's export
it too for later reference.

```bash
export NM_NAME="Wired connection 1"
```

##### Linux bridge

Here is an example of creating a persistent Linux bridge with NetworkManager.
It will take a device such as `eth1` (substitute as appropriate) and convert it
into a bridge.

Remember your device's existing NetworkManager connection name from above, you
will use it below (e.g. `Wired connection 1`).

```bash
export NET_DEV=eth1
export NM_NAME="Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli con add ifname br0 type bridge con-name br0
sudo nmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname "${NET_DEV}" master br0
```

OK now you have your bridge device! Note the bridge will have a different MAC
address to the underlying device, so if you're expecting it to get a specific
address, you'll need to update your DHCP static lease.

```bash
sudo ip link show dev br0
```

Disable the current NetworkManager config for the device so that it doesn't
conflict with the bridge (don't delete it yet, you may lose connection if
you're using it for SSH).

```
sudo nmcli con modify id "${NM_NAME}" ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method disabled
```

Now you can either simply `reboot`, or stop the current interface and bring up
the bridge in one command. Remember that the bridge will have a new MAC address
so it will get a new IP, unless you've updated your DHCP static leases!

```bash
sudo nmcli con down "${NM_NAME}" ; sudo nmcli con up br0
```

As mentioned above, by default the Linux bridge will get an address via DHCP.
If you don't want it to be on the network (you might have another dedicated
interface) then disable DHCP on it.

```bash
sudo nmcli con modify id br0 ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method disabled
```

###### Using Linux bridge in inventory

There's nothing to do on the `kvmhost` side of the inventory.

For any guests you want to connect to the bridge, simply specify it in their
inventory. Use `br0` as the `name` of a network under `virt_infra_networks`
with type `bridge`.

```yaml
      virt_infra_networks:
        - name: br0
          type: bridge
```

##### Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge

Here is an example of creating a persistent OVS bridge with NetworkManager. It
will take a device such as `eth1` (substitute as appropriate) and convert it
into an ovs-bridge.

You will need openvswitch installed as well as the OVS NetworkManager plugin
(substitute for your distro).

```bash
sudo dnf install -y NetworkManager-ovs openvswitch
sudo systemctl enable --now openvswitch
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Now we can create the OVS bridge (assumes your device is `eth1` and existing
NetworkManager config is `Wired connection 1`, substitute as appropriate).

```bash
export NET_DEV=eth1
export NM_NAME="Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli con add type ovs-bridge conn.interface ovs-bridge con-name ovs-bridge
sudo nmcli con add type ovs-port conn.interface port-ovs-bridge master ovs-bridge
sudo nmcli con add type ovs-interface slave-type ovs-port conn.interface ovs-bridge master port-ovs-bridge
sudo nmcli con add type ovs-port conn.interface ovs-port-eth master ovs-bridge con-name ovs-port-eth
sudo nmcli con add type ethernet conn.interface "${NET_DEV}" master ovs-port-eth con-name ovs-int-eth
```

Disable the current NetworkManager config for the device so that it doesn't
conflict with the bridge (don't delete it yet, you may lose connection if
you're using it for SSH).

```
sudo nmcli con modify id "${NM_NAME}" ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method disabled
```

Now you can either simply `reboot`, or stop the current interface and bring up
the bridge in one command.

```bash
sudo nmcli con down "${NM_NAME}" ; sudo nmcli con up ovs-slave-ovs-bridge
```

By default the OVS bridge will get an address via DHCP. If you don't want it to
be on the network (you might have another dedicated interface) then disable
DHCP on it.

```bash
sudo nmcli con modify id ovs-slave-ovs-bridge ipv4.method disabled ipv6.method disabled
```

Show the switch config and bridge with OVS tools.

```bash
sudo ovs-vsctl show
```

###### Using ovs-bridge in inventory

Now you can use `ovs-bridge` as the `device` of an `ovs` bridge in your
`kvmhost` inventory `virt_infra_host_networks` entry and it will create the OVS
libvirt networks for you. You can set up multiple VLANs and set one as default
native (if required).

```yaml
      virt_infra_host_networks:
        present:
          - name: ovs-bridge
            bridge_dev: ovs-bridge
            type: ovs
            portgroup:
              # This is a portgroup with multiple VLANs
              # It is native VLAN 1 and also allows traffic tagged with VLAN 99
              - name: ovs-trunk
                trunk: true
                native_vlan: 1
                vlan:
                  - 1
                  - 99
              # This is portgroup just for native VLAN 1
              - name: default
                native_vlan: 1
                vlan:
                  - 1
              # This is portgroup just for native VLAN 99
              - name: other
                native_vlan: 99
                vlan:
                  - 99
```

You can then specify your VMs to be on specific portgroups and libvirt will
automatically set up the ports for your VMs and you.

```yaml
      virt_infra_networks:
        - name: ovs-bridge
          portgroup: default
          type: ovs
```

Once your VMs are running, you can see their OVS ports with `sudo ovs-vsctl
show`.

### Guest Cloud images

This is designed to use standard cloud images provided by various distros
(OpenStack [provides some
suggestions](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html)).

Make sure the Image you're specifying for your guests already exists under your
libvirt storage dir (by default this is _/var/lib/libvirt/images/_).

I have tested the following guests successfully:

* CentOS 7
  * https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
* CentOS 8
  * https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8/x86_64/images/CentOS-8-GenericCloud-8.1.1911-20200113.3.x86_64.qcow2
* Fedora 31
  * https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-31-1.9.x86_64.qcow2
* Fedora 32
  * https://download.fedoraproject.org/linux/releases/32/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-32-1.6.x86_64.qcow2
* Debian 10
  * http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/debian-10.2.0-openstack-amd64.qcow2
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  * http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  * http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
* openSUSE 15.2 JeOS
  * http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.2/appliances/openSUSE-Leap-15.2-JeOS.x86_64-OpenStack-Cloud.qcow2

So that we can configure the guest and get its IP, both cloud-init and
qemu-guest-agent will be installed into you guest's image, just in case.

Sysprep is also run on the guest image to make sure it's clean of things like
old MAC addresses.

## Role Variables

The defaults are set in the _defaults/main.yml_ file.

These can be overridden at host or hostgroup level, as necessary. However, the
role is designed to pretty much work out of the box (so long as you have the
default CentOS image).

```yaml

## Example Inventory

The separate [virt-infra repo](https://github.com/csmart/virt-infra-ansible)
has sample inventory files and site playbook to call the role, which might be
helpful.

It might be best if the inventories are split into multiple files for ease of
management, under an _inventory_ directory or such.

The inventory used with this role must include a hostgroup called _kvmhost_ and
other hostgroups for guests.

Custom settings can be provided for each host or group of hosts in the
inventory.

To create a new group of guests to manage, create a new yml file under the
inventory directory. For example, if you wanted a set of guests for
OpenStack, you could create an openstack.yml file and populate it as required.

To manage specific hosts or groups, simply use Ansible's _--limit_ option to
specify the hosts or hostgroups (must also include _kvmhost_ group). This way
you can use the one inventory for lots of different guests and manage them
separately.

The KVM host is where the libvirt networks are created and therefore specified
as vars under that hostgroup.

Here is an example inventory file _simple.yml_ in YAML format. It is specifying
_kvmhost_ as localhost and creating three _simple_ CentOS guests, using the
role defaults.  Note there are two networks being created (_default_ and
_example_) and one which is removed (_other_).


```yaml

        - name: "example"
          ip_address: "192.168.113.1"
          subnet: "255.255.255.0"

simple:
  hosts:
    centos-simple-[0:2]:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python
```

If you want a group of VMs to all be the same, set the vars at the hostgroup
level. You can still override hostgroup vars with individual vars for specific
hosts, if required.

Here's an example setting various hostgroup and individual host vars.

```yaml

## YAML based inventory, see:
## https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/yaml.html
#
example:
  hosts:
    centos-7-example:
      virt_infra_state: shutdown
      virt_infra_timezone: "Australia/Melbourne"
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python
      virt_infra_networks:
        - name: "br0"
          type: bridge
        - name: "extra_network"
          type: nat
          model: e1000
        - name: ovs-bridge
          portgroup: ovs-portgroup
          type: ovs
      virt_infra_disks:
        - name: "boot"
        - name: "nvme"
          size: "100"
          bus: "nvme"
    centos-8-example:
      virt_infra_timezone: "Australia/Adelaide"

      - name: "data"
        bus: "sata"

```

## Example Playbook

I've tried to keep the Ansible as a simple, logical set of steps and not get
too tricky. Having said that, the playbook is quite specific.

There are some tasks which can only be run on the KVM host and others in a
specific order. Some of the tasks need to be looped through with play_hosts but
only run once and delegated to the KVM host, like updating _/etc/hosts_ and
_~/.ssh/config_ on KVM host. Doing it this way avoids running in serial, which
is messy.

This code will also help by running a bunch of validation checks on the KVM
host and for your guest configs to try to catch anything that's not right.

Here is an example playbook _virt-infra.yml_ which calls the role.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - ansible-role-virt-infra
```

### Grab the cloud image

Before we run the playbook, download the CentOS cloud image.

```bash
curl -O https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2
sudo mv -iv CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/
```

### Run the playbook

Now run the Ansible playbook against the kvmhost and the guests in the _simple_
group (note that we limit to both the _kvmhost_ and the _simple_ hostgroups).

```bash
ansible-playbook \
--ask-become-pass \
--inventory ./inventory.d \
--limit kvmhost,simple \
./virt-infra.yml
```

You can also override a number of guest settings on the command line.

```bash
ansible-playbook \
--ask-become-pass \
--limit kvmhost,simple \
./virt-infra.yml \
-e virt_infra_root_password=password \
-e virt_infra_disk_size=100 \
-e virt_infra_ram=4096 \
-e virt_infra_ram_max=8192 \
-e virt_infra_cpus=8 \
-e virt_infra_cpus_max=16 \
-e '{ "virt_infra_networks": [{ "name": "br0", "type": "bridge" }] }' \
-e virt_infra_state=running
```

### Cleanup

To delete the guests in a hostgroup you could specify them (or a specific host)
with --limit and pass in _virt_infra_state=undefined_ as a command line extra
arg.

This will override the guest state to undefined and if they exist, they will be
deleted.

For example, to delete all VMs in the _simple_ hostgroup.

```bash
ansible-playbook \
--ask-become-pass \
--inventory simple.yml \
--limit kvmhost,simple \
--extra-vars virt_infra_state=undefined \
./virt-infra.yml
```

If you want to just shut them down, try _virt_infra_state=shutdown_
instead.

For example, to shutdown just the _simple-centos-2_ host.

```bash
ansible-playbook \
--ask-become-pass \
--inventory simple.yml \
--limit kvmhost,simple-centos-2 \
--extra-vars virt_infra_state=shutdown \
./virt-infra.yml
```

### Post setup configuration

Once you have set up your infra, you could run another playbook against your
same inventory to do whatever you wanted with those machines...

```yaml
---
- name: Upgrade all packages
  package:
    name: '*'
    state: latest
  become: true
  register: result_package_update
  retries: 30
  delay: 10
  until: result_package_update is succeeded

- name: Install packages
  package:
    name:
      - git
      - tmux
      - vim
    state: present
  become: true
  register: result_package_install
  retries: 30
  delay: 10
  until: result_package_install is succeeded
```
